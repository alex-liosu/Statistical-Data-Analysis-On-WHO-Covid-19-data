# Statistical Data Analysis on WHO Covid-19 Data

## 📖 Introduction  
This project presents a statistical analysis of the **World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dataset**, exploring trends, patterns, and insights from the global pandemic data. The goal is to demonstrate statistical and data visualization techniques to better understand the spread and impact of COVID-19.  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
- **Data Source**: WHO COVID-19 dataset (daily confirmed cases, deaths, and other health indicators).  
- **Techniques Applied**:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - Time series visualization of confirmed cases and deaths.  
  - Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  - Comparative analysis across countries and regions.  
  - Trend identification using statistical plots.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- Source: **WHO COVID-19 data repository**.  
- Content: Country-level daily records of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and related metadata.  
- Format: CSV/structured dataset imported and analyzed in R/Python.  

## 🚀 Implementation  
- Data wrangling and transformation.  
- Visualizations including line plots, bar plots, and geographical maps.  
- Statistical summaries of case counts and mortality rates.  
- Comparative analysis across different continents.  

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Clear visualization of pandemic waves across countries.  
- Identification of regions with the highest case growth and death toll.  
- Observations on differences in outbreak severity across continents.  


## ✅ Conclusion  
- The WHO dataset provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic.  
- Statistical methods and visualization tools help uncover meaningful trends.  
- The project illustrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in public health.
